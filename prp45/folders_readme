BAM		mapped reads (BAM files); generated automatically

efficiency	CSV spreadsheets of splicing efficiency values for 5' and 3' splice 
		site of each intron (calculations for introns with sufficient read coverage
		are given in '_conf.csv' files):
		- splicing_efficiency in all samples
		- relative_splicing_efficinecy compared to selected control (e.g., mutant vs WT);
		generated automatically

FASTQ		unmapped reads (FASTQ files); user-generated, files downloaded manually

FastQC_output	read quality control results (HTML files); generated automatically

genome		genome sequence and annotation:
		- genome sequence in FASTA format
		- HISAT2 genome index
		- genome annotation in GTF format
		- coordinates of 5' and 3' end bases of known introns (BED format);
		user-generated, all files except BED files downloaded manually

images		plots (PDF files) of:
		- comparisons of calculated splicing efficiencies (e.g., mutant vs WT)
		- coverage of intron 5' and 3' end bases for each sample;
		generated automatically

introns		CSV spreadsheets of read counts (coverage) for 5' and 3' splice site
		of each known intron in all samples; generated automatically

transreads	CSV spreadsheets of transread counts (coverage) in all samples for:
		- all identified splice junctions
		- known splice junctions;
		generated automatically
